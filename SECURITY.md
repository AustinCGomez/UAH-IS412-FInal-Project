## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please submit security vulnerbilities to the 'Issues' tab for any that are discovered and the maintainers of the project will attempt to fix them. NOTE: This project is considered to be a 'demo' and not production-proof in this specific fork. 
We recommend that you try and fix the security vulnerbilities in your 'fork' of the project as this one will receive minimal updates after December 25th 2021 and will be taken off the AWS servers on December 18th 2021.
